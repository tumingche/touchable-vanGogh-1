String text_vase = "This shiny light blue vase appears in two other still lifes, Vase with lilacs, daisies and anemones and Vase with cornflowers and poppies, which were probably painted around the same time (June 1887).";
String text_x_ray = "Van Gogh painted this still life on a previously used, horizontal canvas, probably a depiction of a rather fiat landscape. This scene was scraped off and the canvas covered with a new ground, on which traces of an underdrawing in charcoal or black pencil can be found, showing the contours of the vase and some of the flowers.";
String text_motif = "As a motif, the flower still life is treated rather traditionally, with an almost old-fashioned placing of the vase in an extremely simple and orderly composition. The modelling of the paint in non-systematic touches, alternating between short and longer strokes, and the brilliant colouration of the bouquet, on the other hand, testify to Van Gogh's increasing technical command and self-confidence. His goal of mastering the use of intense colours and colour contrasts with the help of such flower pieces can herewith be regarded as fulfilled—despite the fact that some of the colours have faded or darkened.";
String text_background = "The period of experimentation was over. The lesson of impressionism and neo-impressionism, which he had initially sought to make his own through rather close imitation, had now been learned and integrated into a highly personal, unaffected blend of impressionist light and pointillist touch.";
String text_sale = "In February 1892, Albert Aurier wrote a letter to his sister in which he advised her to purchase a flower still life by Van Gogh then for sale for 15 francs at a Paris 'marchand de bric a brac.' This paining is believed to be Flowers in a blue vase.";
